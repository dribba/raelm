One day this might be a complete mapping tool like Leaflet / D3 developed in Elm

To learn Elm I'm taking Leaflet as an example to start a project that provides similiar functionality.
Leaflet is a javascript library helping you create maps and showing geospatial data on them.

# install
- npm install
- elm-package install
- npm run dev
